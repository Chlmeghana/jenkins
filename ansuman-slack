Lakshmi Meghana Chekka
  10:21 PM
It got stuck in the middle so... i exitted from hod


Ansuman Mohanty
  10:22 PM
ok


Lakshmi Meghana Chekka
  10:22 PM
I didnt kill it... How to kill now?


Ansuman Mohanty
  10:22 PM
looks like that port is not free. Wait for some time.


Lakshmi Meghana Chekka
  10:22 PM
I am using different credentials from my frds its still the same


Ansuman Mohanty
  10:23 PM
The port is same.
10:23
it is shared across IDs
10:24
Or you login to your friend’s VM and exit the process by typing hx.


Lakshmi Meghana Chekka
  10:24 PM
Oh ok...
One thing i have dbt.... we need to execute rsserver before taking inputs from the client right....
so some how I need to open the hod.... I cannot directly do everything from jenkins:thinking_face:


Ansuman Mohanty
  10:24 PM
if the process is still running.
10:24
Right.
10:25
You have to start the rsserver first
10:25
and then run the jenkins job.


Lakshmi Meghana Chekka
  10:25 PM

Lakshmi Meghana Chekka
  2:40 PM
Ok...
So u didnt use the rsclient code?


Ansuman Mohanty
  2:41 PM
rsclient code will not run on mac
2:41
also need to modify the server code to communicate with mac..


Lakshmi Meghana Chekka
  2:42 PM
Ok
can you share me that... I will go through it:sweat_smile:

  124       end
2:43
Need to set the ASCII mode..
2:43
check 119 to 121
2:44
make this change on the server side...
2:45
then if you want the rsclient to work, you need to change the client side also..


Lakshmi Meghana Chekka
  2:46 PM
oh ok... I will modify them


Ansuman Mohanty

Check this python program that you can run on mac

3:18
Still needs some formatting/beautification changes..but the basic objective is achieved..
3:18
Run the rsserver with the modifications for SO_ASCII
3:19
and then run this python code on mac..
3:19
you should get some output..


Lakshmi Meghana Chekka
  3:23 PM
Ok anshuman... I will execute now

Hi ansuman, I made some modifications in the emulator script on the same day you explained me about the edl compilation... But I didn't checked it with my userid on gdlvm7 cause I was busy with other works.
Now I checked but it says my userid don't have access to TCPC0 library... Can you tell me how can I get that access
12:27
This is when I executed using edl compile command

This is when I executed edl dev user interface

Ansuman Mohanty

ok...Maybe I can execute the script and check..
12:29
you may pass me all the related files..
12:29
Or better
12:29
if you can create a github project with these files..
12:29
and pass me on the repo link..
12:29
I can clone it..


Lakshmi Meghana Chekka
  12:30 PM
Can you tell me how can I get the access to TCPC0... I want to check with my userid


Ansuman Mohanty
  12:30 PM
again it requires permissions that i think its difficult to get..
12:30
you may ask Sowmiya..


Lakshmi Meghana Chekka

Can you write one login_here function.. which does a login userid here on the command
1:39
 Fill in your USERID and PASSWORD and press ENTER
 (Your password will not appear when you type it)
 USERID   ===>
 PASSWORD ===>

 COMMAND  ===> logon ansuman here
                                                            RUNNING   GDLVM7
4A                                                 S                    042/034
